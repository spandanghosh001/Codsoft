## 1. Iris Classification:
In this data science project, we explore the popular Iris dataset to build a classification model that can accurately identify and classify different species of iris flowers based on their attributes. Using Python and machine learning algorithms, we preprocess the data, perform feature selection, and train various classifiers such as Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors to determine the most effective model. The project aims to showcase the power of supervised learning techniques in accurately classifying multiclass data, making it an excellent starting point for those new to the field of data science.

## 2. Sales Prediction using Python:
In this data science project, we tackle the challenging task of sales prediction using Python and advanced regression techniques. By leveraging historical sales data and additional relevant features, we create a predictive model to forecast future sales for a given time period or region. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection, wherein we compare the performance of linear regression, random forests, and gradient boosting algorithms. The results provide valuable insights into potential sales trends and help businesses make informed decisions, optimize inventory management, and plan their marketing strategies effectively.

## 3. Credit Card Fraud Detection:
In this data science project, we address the critical issue of credit card fraud detection using machine learning and Python. With the increasing prevalence of online transactions, fraudsters continually seek ways to exploit vulnerabilities. We analyze a real-world credit card transaction dataset and employ various anomaly detection algorithms such as Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and One-Class SVM to identify fraudulent activities. The project focuses on achieving a balance between precision and recall to minimize both false positives and false negatives, ensuring that genuine transactions are not mistakenly flagged as fraudulent. By successfully detecting and preventing credit card fraud, this project serves as a powerful tool to protect customers and financial institutions from potential financial losses.
